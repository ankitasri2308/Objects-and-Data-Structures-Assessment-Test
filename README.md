**NUMBER:-**
There are different categories of numbers in Python. Mostly used are Integers and Floats.
Integers are numbers without decimal point. It can be either negative or positive. For Example: +15, -20 , +1000 . Floats are numbers with decimal point. Example: 15.01 , -20.81 , 0.08. You can perform many operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Power, and Division on Integers and Floats.
Also, there are operations like Floor Division and Modulo. Floor division denoted as ‘//’ returns only the integer part of the result after division. Modulo operation(%) returns the remainder after division .

**STRINGS:-**
Strings refers to the sequence of characters in Python. Strings are always written in quotation marks (single, double, or triple) and are Immutable. It means that the elements of string cannot be edited after definition. Different operations that can be performed on Strings are Indexing, Slicing, Concatenation, Repetition. Also, there are various in-built method in Strings such as upper(), lower(),split(),strip(),lstrip(),rstrip() and many others that can be studied. Below are various examples and explanation of operations and methods in String with comments(denoted as ‘#’ for understanding purpose).
String Indexing is used to return elements of a string at a particular index. 

**Lists:-**
List is a collection of items containing data of different types. The indexing of List starts with zero. If a length of a list is three, indexes are 0,1,2. I have shared multiple examples of different List operations with output and comments for better understanding.

**Tuple:-**
Tuples are immutable data types with a collection of different types of data. It does not support object assignment. They are used for passing objects without getting changed for data integrity. It is written with a small bracket. Let us see an example for clarity.
Note that Tuples operations are similar to the Lists. Except, Tuples are not mutable and defined with small brackets.

**DICTIONARIES:-**
Dictionaries in Python are key-value pairs collection. Key and Value can be of any data type. There is a mapping of the key with the corresponding value. Keys are used to look-up for the values. Dictionaries are written within curly ‘{}’ braces.
In the second example dictionary ‘newd’ is created and key ‘India’ and ‘Indonesia’ are added. Hence new elements can be added in the dictionary.
